## Overview 
Being able to accurately forecast the market value of used cars can be beneficial for both buyers and sellers. Many people become interested in the used car market at some point in their lives, either because they want to sell their own vehicle or buy a pre-owned one. However, it's important not to pay too much or sell for less than the market value.

The purpose of this project is to predict the price of used cars by analyzing various features such as Present_Price, Selling_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Year, etc. The data used for this project was sourced from Kaggle.
